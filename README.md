# Interview Coding Challenges for Front End Engineer
Trying to sharpen my coding skills, I felt that the best and **most practical** way was to solve some of the interview questions circulating on the internet from companies like Facebook, Airbnb, etc.



### I've compiled a list of the challenges that I've gone thru here: `src/index.html`
### Of course the solutions are also available in my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/collection/DPGyrg/#)
1. Given two identical (but not the same) DOM trees, and a node from one of them, how do you find the same node in from other tree?
2. How do you deeply flatten an array, recursively & iteratively?
3. Given a M x N matrix of characters, we want a message that starts from character at (0, 0).
      We then move 1 column right and one row down to get the next character, except:
      If we run out of rows down, then move one row up instead, and vise versa.
      If we run out of columns, then the message ends.
4. We want to do a type-ahead search whenever user enters a character, but we only want to call the API 500ms after user stops typing, how do you implement this?
5. Using HTML and CSS, how would you create an image that would display another image (aligned to the bottom, right) when the user hovers over the image?
6. How to implement square root function?
